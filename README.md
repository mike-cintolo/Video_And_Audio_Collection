# Multimedia Data Collection and Analysis Project

## Overview

This project showcases my data collection, web scraping, database design, and data analysis expertise. I collected and analyzed a diverse dataset of video and audio files from various sources, including TV shows, old-time radio programs, movies, music, and audiobooks. This README provides an overview of the project and its key components.

## Project Components

### Data Collection and Cleaning

- Collected 1.7 terabytes of multimedia data from a wide range of sources.
- Developed a rigorous naming standard to organize and categorize files.
- Utilized Python scripts to automate the cleaning and preparation of data.
- Ensured data quality and consistency by researching and cleaning file names.

### Web Scraping and API Access

- Leveraged web scraping techniques to gather additional metadata and information about multimedia content.
- Utilized APIs to access relevant data from online sources.
- Developed Python programs for web scraping and API interactions.
- Integrated scraped and API-sourced data into the project database.

### Database Design and Management

- Designed and implemented a MySQL database to house multimedia file information.
- Created a structured schema to store efficiently and query data.
- Wrote Python scripts to parse file names and populate the database with metadata.
- Established relationships between tables to facilitate data retrieval.

### Data Analysis and Insights

- Conducted data analysis to uncover insights from the multimedia dataset.
- Utilized data visualization tools to create charts, graphs, and visual representations of key findings.
- Extracted meaningful trends and correlations from the data.
- Derived actionable insights that can inform decision-making.

## Technologies Used

- Python for data cleaning, web scraping, and analysis.
- MySQL for database design and management.
- Data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating visualizations.
- Web scraping tools and APIs for data collection.
- Other relevant libraries and tools as needed for specific tasks.

## Project Impact

- Improved data organization and accessibility for multimedia content.
- Enhanced data quality and metadata information through web scraping.
- Enabled data-driven decision-making through data analysis and visualization.
- Demonstrated data collection, cleaning, analysis, and database design skills.
